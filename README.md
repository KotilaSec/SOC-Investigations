# SOC-Investigations

### 🔍 Purpose
**SOC-Investigations** is a collection of real-world and simulated security investigations designed to document the **detection, analysis, and response** workflows used in a modern Security Operations Center (SOC).  
Each investigation focuses on an end-to-end case — from initial alert to containment and lessons learned — using realistic telemetry and tools such as **Microsoft Defender, Splunk, and KQL**.

This repository serves as both a **knowledge base** and a **training resource** for analysts, defenders, and researchers interested in structured incident documentation, detection engineering, and purple-team learning.

### 📘 Report Format
Each investigation follows a standardized structure:

1. **Executive Summary** – High-level narrative and impact overview.  
2. **Findings** – Evidence-driven description of attacker behavior (mapped to MITRE ATT&CK).  
3. **Timeline** – Event chronology with host, action, and timestamp.  
4. **Recommendations** – Tactical, short-term, and long-term remediations.  
5. **IOCs & Queries** – Indicators and KQL/Wazuh/Sigma searches used in validation.  
6. **Appendix** – Screenshots, log samples, hash lists, or dataset snippets.
